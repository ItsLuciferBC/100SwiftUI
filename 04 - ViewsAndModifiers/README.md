[<< 03 - Guess the Flag](../03%20-%20Guess%20the%20Flag/) | [05 - Milestone 1 >>](../05%20-%20Milestone%201/)

## 📝 What I Learned

some View, Conditional modifiers, Environment modifiers, View Composition, Custom containers.

## 🏆 Challenges

> 1. Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
>
>
> 1. Go back to project 2 and replace the `Image` view used for flags with a new `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
>
>
> 1. Create a custom `ViewModifier` (and accompanying `View` extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.
