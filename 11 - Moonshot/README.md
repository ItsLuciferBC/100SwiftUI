## 📝 What I Learned

GeometryReader, ScrollView, NavigationLink, Creating layout (Grid) LazyVGrid / LazyHGrid, more hands-on Codable, generics and more.


## 🏆 Challenges

> 1. Add the launch date to **MissionView**, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you.
>
> 1. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in **MissionView** is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the **Rectangle** dividers out too.
>
> 1. For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to **ContentView** that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list.
