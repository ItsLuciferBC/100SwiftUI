## 📝 What I Learned

URLSession, disabled(), haptics, @Binding, @Bindable, AsyncImage and more.


## 🏆 Challenges

> 1. Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if it’s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.
>
> 1. If our call to **placeOrder()** fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, try commenting out the **request.httpMethod = "POST"** line in your code, which should force the request to fail.
>
> 1. For a more challenging task, try updating the **Order** class so it saves data such as the user's delivery address to **UserDefaults**. This takes a little thinking, because **@AppStorage** won't work here, and you'll find getters and settings cause problems with **Codable** support. Can you find a middle ground?
