## 🏆 Challenges

> Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.
>
>Breaking it down:
>
> - The player needs to select which multiplication tables they want to practice. This could be pressing buttons, or it could be an “Up to…” stepper, going from 2 to 12.
> - The player should be able to select how many questions they want to be asked: 5, 10, or 20.
> - You should randomly generate as many questions as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.
