## üèÜ Challenges

> Your first step should be to examine the JSON. The URL you want to use is this: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/samples/friendface.json ‚Äì that‚Äôs a massive collection of randomly generated data for example users.
> As you can see, there is an array of people, and each person has an ID, name, age, email address, and more. They also have an array of tag strings, and an array of friends, where each friend has a name and ID.
> How far you implement this is down to you, but at the very least you should:
> 1. Fetch the data and parse it into **User** and **Friend** structs.
> 1. Display a list of users with a little information about them, such as their name and whether they are active right now.
> 1. Create a detail view shown when a user is tapped, presenting more information about them, including the names of their friends.
> 1. Before you start your download, check that your **User** array is empty so that you don‚Äôt keep starting the download every time the view is shown.

> **SwiftData:** Yes, your job today is to expand your app so that it uses SwiftData. Your boss just emailed you to say the app is great, but once the JSON has been fetched they really want it to work offline. This means you need to use SwiftData to store the information you download, then use your SwiftData models to display the views you designed ‚Äì you should only fetch the data once.
