## 📝 What I Learned

Hashable, Codable, Equatable, Navigation Destination, Navigation Path.

## 🏆 Challenges

> 1. Change project 7 (iExpense) so that it uses **NavigationLink** for adding new expenses rather than a sheet. (Tip: The **dismiss()** code works great here, but you might want to add the **navigationBarBackButtonHidden()** modifier so they have to explicitly choose Cancel.)
>
> 1. Try changing project 7 so that it lets users edit their issue name in the navigation title rather than a separate textfield. Which option do you prefer?
>
> 1. Return to project 8 (Moonshot), and upgrade it to use **NavigationLink(value:)**. This means adding **Hashable** conformance, and thinking carefully how to use **navigationDestination()**.
