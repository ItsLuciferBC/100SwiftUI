## 📝 What I Learned

List, Bundle, UITextChecker, onAppear, fatalError()

## 🏆 Challenges

> 1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
>
> 1. Add a toolbar button that calls `startGame()`, so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
>
> 1. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
