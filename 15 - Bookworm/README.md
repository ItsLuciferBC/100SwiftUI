## üìù What I Learned

@Binding, TextEditor, SwiftData, SortDescriptor and more.


## üèÜ Challenges

> 1. Right now it‚Äôs possible to select no title, author, or genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing defaults, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres ‚Äì you can choose.
>
> 1. Modify **ContentView** so that books rated as 1 star are highlighted somehow, such as having their name shown in red.
>
> 1. Add a new ‚Äúdate‚Äù attribute to the Book class, assigning Date.now to it so it gets the current date and time, then format that nicely somewhere in DetailView.
